# Cross-Domain

Domain: `cross-domain`

Cross-domain correlation domain that bridges analysis results across multiple domains, supporting workflow orchestration and evidence graph integration.

## Profiles

- full

## Typical scenarios

- Cross-domain evidence correlation
- Automated reverse engineering workflows
- Multi-signal aggregation analysis

## Common combinations

- cross-domain + instrumentation
- cross-domain + v8-inspector + canvas
