# Canvas

Domain: `canvas`

Canvas game engine reverse analysis domain plus Skia rendering capture, supporting Laya, Pixi, Phaser, Cocos, and Unity engines for fingerprinting, scene tree dumping, object picking, and Skia GPU backend detection and scene extraction.

## Profiles

- workflow
- full

## Typical scenarios

- Game engine fingerprinting and version detection
- Scene node tree export
- Coordinate-based object picking
- Click event handler tracing
- Skia GPU backend detection and scene extraction

## Common combinations

- browser + canvas + debugger
- canvas + trace

## Full tool list (8)

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `canvas_engine_fingerprint` | Detect Canvas/WebGL game engines in the page. |
| `canvas_scene_dump` | Extract the full scene tree / display list from a detected canvas engine. |
| `canvas_pick_object_at_point` | Pick / hit-test the topmost object at a given screen coordinate using the engine's hit-test system |
| `canvas_trace_click_handler` | Trace a click event from DOM to JS call stack. |
| `canvas_scene_search` | Search a previously-dumped scene tree (canvas_scene_dump output) for nodes by name regex and/or type. Pure-compute — no browser session required. Returns matching nodes with their path from root, depth, and engine-specific properties. |
| `skia_detect_renderer` | Detect the active Skia renderer backend from the current page context. |
| `skia_extract_scene` | Extract a lightweight Skia scene tree from the selected canvas. |
| `skia_correlate_objects` | Correlate requested Skia node identifiers with the extracted scene tree. |
