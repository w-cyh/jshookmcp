# Native Emulator

Domain: `native-emulator`

In-process, dependency-free self-built ARM64 interpreter for emulating Android `.so` libraries: load a shared object, register mock Java methods, and invoke exported or `Java_*` JNI functions to recover signing/crypto algorithms — no device, JVM, or Frida. Sessions are isolated and explicitly managed (create → … → destroy) with idle auto-expiry. libapp.so (Flutter Dart AOT) is not executable here and routes to the Dart layer.

## Profiles

- full

## Typical scenarios

- Recover native/JNI signing and crypto algorithms
- Extract and load arm64-v8a .so from an APK
- Instruction-trace an obfuscated native function
- Mock the Java world via declarative callbacks

## Common combinations

- native-emulator + binary-instrument
- native-emulator + dart-inspector

## Full tool list (20)

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `nemu_capabilities` | Report native-emulator backend availability, supported features, and explicit ISA/SIMD gaps. Unsupported opcodes fail loudly instead of being reported as emulated. |
| `nemu_create_session` | Create an isolated ARM64 emulator session and return its sessionId. Each session owns its own CPU registers, guest stack, and JNI object table, so concurrent analyses never interfere. Destroy it with nemu_destroy_session when done; idle sessions auto-expire. |
| `nemu_destroy_session` | Destroy an emulator session and free its memory (mapped library, stack, JNI tables). |
| `nemu_list_sessions` | List active emulator sessions with their creation and last-use timestamps. |
| `nemu_load_library` | Load an AArch64 ELF shared object (.so) from a filesystem path into a session, mapping its segments and resolving exported symbols. Prerequisite for list_symbols / call_symbol / call_jni_export. |
| `nemu_inspect_imports` | Inspect an AArch64 ELF .so before emulation and list imported symbols from dynamic relocations, including GOT offsets and whether each import is backed by the built-in bionic stubs. Use this to diagnose PLT/GOT NULL indirect-call failures without writing ad-hoc readelf/Capstone scripts. |
| `nemu_extract_apk_libs` | List the loadable arm64-v8a native libraries (.so) packaged inside an APK, with their byte sizes. Use nemu_load_apk_library to load one. Note: libapp.so (Flutter Dart AOT) is listed but is not executable here — route it to the Dart layer. |
| `nemu_load_apk_library` | Extract a specific arm64-v8a .so from an APK by name and load it into a session in one step (no temp files). Pair with nemu_extract_apk_libs to discover library names. |
| `nemu_list_symbols` | List the exported function symbols of the loaded library — the names callable via call_symbol / call_jni_export. |
| `nemu_call_symbol` | Invoke an exported function by name following AArch64 AAPCS (integer args in x0..x7, result in x0). For plain native exports; use call_jni_export for `Java_*` JNI entry points. |
| `nemu_call_jni_export` | Invoke an exported `Java_*` JNI function. Injects the guest `JNIEnv*` and thiz, then the Java arguments. Returns x0 — an int/jboolean directly, or a jobject/jbyteArray/jstring handle to resolve via read_byte_array. The main entry point for reversing a native signing/crypto routine. |
| `nemu_setup_java_mock` | Register a mock Java method the emulated native code can call back into via JNI (GetMethodID/GetStaticMethodID + `Call*Method`). Declaratively specify the return value with returnInt, returnString, or returnBytes (base64) — emulating the 'Java world' a native routine reads from before computing its result. No code is executed; only the configured constant is returned. |
| `nemu_setup_java_field` | Register a mock Java field the emulated native code reads back via JNI (GetFieldID/GetStaticFieldID + Get&lt;Type&gt;Field). Declaratively specify the value with valueInt, valueString, or valueBytes (base64) — the 'Java world' constant a native routine folds into its result. No code is executed. |
| `nemu_new_byte_array` | Wrap base64 bytes as a JNI jbyteArray handle to pass as an argument into call_jni_export (e.g. the plaintext a signing routine consumes). Returns the handle. |
| `nemu_read_byte_array` | Resolve a jbyteArray handle (e.g. a native call's return value) back to its bytes, returned as base64 plus length. |
| `nemu_trace` | Invoke an exported symbol while recording every instruction executed (pc, opcode, step), optionally snapshotting named registers per step. Bounded by maxSteps. Use to follow the control flow / algorithm of an obfuscated native function. |
| `nemu_disassemble` | Disassemble a single instruction without creating an emulator session. Supports arm64/aarch64, x86, x64, riscv32/riscv64, mips/mips32, and mipsel. This is a local lightweight decoder for trace readability, including common SSE/AVX/AVX2/AVX-512 EVEX, RISC-V, and MIPS instructions. |
| `nemu_alloc_memory` | Allocate raw guest memory (NOT a JNI handle — a real char* address). Optionally fill with initial data via fillBytes (base64). Returns the guest address to pass as an integer arg to call_symbol. Use at the start of a session to stage encrypted blobs for a native decrypt/signing routine, then read the output with nemu_read_memory. |
| `nemu_read_memory` | Read raw bytes from guest memory at a given address. Returns a bounded preview by default; set includeDataBase64=true for full base64 within the configured cap. |
| `nemu_write_memory` | Write raw bytes into guest memory at a given address via base64 data. Use to update an input buffer between call_symbol invocations without re-allocating, or to patch code/data in place. |
