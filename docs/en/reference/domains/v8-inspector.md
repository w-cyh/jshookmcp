## Full tool list (10)

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `v8_heap_snapshot_capture` | Capture a V8 heap snapshot for offline analysis. |
| `v8_heap_snapshot_analyze` | Analyze a heap snapshot: class histogram (object count/sizes by constructor), statistics (total objects, detached DOM nodes), optional dominator tree, and leak detection. |
| `v8_heap_diff` | Compare two heap snapshots to find allocation changes. |
| `v8_object_inspect` | Inspect a live JS object by objectId with property enumeration. |
| `v8_heap_stats` | Report V8 heap statistics: used, total, external. |
| `v8_bytecode_extract` | Extract V8 bytecode for a script by scriptId, with source fallback. |
| `v8_version_detect` | Detect V8 engine version, flags, and runtime capabilities. |
| `v8_jit_inspect` | Report JIT compilation status and optimization tier for a script. |
| `v8_heap_find_leaks` | Find suspected memory leaks in a heap snapshot. Returns leak candidates sorted by confidence, including detached DOM nodes, large arrays, closure leaks, and unexpectedly large retained objects. |
| `v8_heap_retainers` | Trace retainer chains from suspect leak objects back to GC roots. For each nodeId, walks the immediate-dominator chain to produce a "what keeps it alive" path: leaf → ... → GC root. Each step includes nodeId, name, className, shallowSize, retainedSize, and distance from the leaf. Use after v8_heap_find_leaks or v8_heap_snapshot_analyze to understand why a specific object is not being collected. |
